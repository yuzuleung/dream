Place your image files here for use in the app.

Put the file `DisneyMoon.JPG` in this directory so the homepage background can use it.
Example path: /public/images/DisneyMoon.JPG

Note: On macOS the filesystem may be case-insensitive; ensure the filename matches exactly if you later reference `DisneyMoon.JPG`.
